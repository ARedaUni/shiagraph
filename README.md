# ShiaGraph - Knowledge Graph Visualization with AI

## Overview

ShiaGraph is an application for visualizing and interacting with a knowledge graph of a Discord server through natural language. The system combines graph visualization with AI-powered querying capabilities, allowing users to explore complex relationships through conversation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

The application follows a modular architecture centered around Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG):

1. **Frontend**
   - Chat interface for natural language interaction
   - Interactive graph visualization for displaying relationships
   - Seamless updates as queries modify the displayed graph

2. **Agent System**
   - Query Builder Agent: Converts natural language to Cypher queries
   - Graph Summarizer Agent: Analyzes graph data to provide human-readable insights
   - Intent classifier to route requests appropriately

3. **Graph RAG Implementation**
   - Extracts relevant subgraphs based on user questions
   - Uses subgraphs as context for AI responses
   - Generates accurate, graph-informed answers

4. **Backend Services**
   ```
   /services
     /agents
       - queryBuilder.ts (Converts natural language to Cypher)
       - graphSummarizer.ts (Analyzes graph data for insights)
       - intentClassifier.ts (Determines query intent)
     /graph
       - client.ts (Neo4j connection and query execution)
       - retriever.ts (Extracts relevant subgraphs)
       - graphRAG.ts (Integrates agents and retrieval)
     /ai
       - llmClient.ts (Abstraction over Gemini/other models)
   ```

5. **API Structure**
   ```
   /api
     /chat
       /stream - Main chat endpoint
     /graph
       /query - Execute Cypher directly
       /rag - Extract subgraph and return with summary
   ```

## User Flow

1. User asks a question (e.g., "Who is from Canada?")
2. The system determines if the question relates to graph data
3. For graph-related questions:
   - Query Builder converts the question to a Cypher query
   - Graph Retriever executes the query against Neo4j
   - Summarizer enriches the response with insights from the graph
   - The UI updates to display both the text response and visualization
4. For general questions:
   - The regular LLM handles the response

## Extensibility

This architecture supports future extensions like:
- Multiple knowledge sources
- Different reasoning agents
- Advanced visualization modes
- User-defined graph queries
- Custom graph algorithms
